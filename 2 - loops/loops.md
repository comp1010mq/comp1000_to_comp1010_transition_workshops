# Loops

Loops are similar to conditions except that after every iteration of the loop, the expression is checked again.

## A `while` loop


```java
while(boolean expression) {
	code inside loop
}
rest of the code
```

<center><img src="figs/whileLoop.png" style="width: 300px;"/></center>

Example:

```java
int a = 6;
int result = 1;
while(a > 0) {
	result = result * a;
	a = a - 1;
}
println(result);
```

<center><img src="figs/whileExample.png" style="width: 300px;"/></center>


The above code executes the loop 6 times (for `a` = 6,5,4,3,2,1 but not for 0) each time multiplying the current value of `a` into `result` and the final value of `result` is 6\*5\*4\*3\*2\*1 = 720. 

There is a better way of tracing loops known as logic table construction. The logic table for the above example is given below.

| a 	| a > 0 	| result      	|
|---	|-------	|-------------	|
| 6 	| true  	| 1\*6 = 6     	|
| 5 	| true  	| 6\*5 = 30    	|
| 4 	| true  	| 30\*4 = 120  	|
| 3 	| true  	| 120\*3 = 360 	|
| 2 	| true  	| 360\*2 = 720 	|
| 1 	| true  	| 720\*1 = 720 	|
| 0 	| false 	|             	|

## Guidelines for constructing a logic table

While constructing a logic table, one is strongly encouraged to follow the following steps:

1. Identify all variables involved in the boolean expression in the loop header.
2. Create columns for each of the variables identified in step 1.
3. Create a column for the loop expression. Create multiple columns to simplify reaching the expression if complex. For example, if expression is `x==y && !z`, the variables involved are `x`, `y`, and `z` and the sub-expressions are `x==y` and `!z`.
4. Create columns for each variable (**unless column for the variable already present**) modified in the loop (in the order they are modified). Don't create columns v

### Example for constructing a logic table

```java
int a = 10, b = 2, c = 100;
int result = 0;
while(a > b && c > a) {
	result = result + 1;
	a = a - 1;
	c = c / 2;
}
```

| a  	| b 	| c   	| a > b 	| c > a 	| a > b && c > a 	| result  	|
|----	|---	|-----	|-------	|-------	|----------------	|---------	|
| 10 	| 2 	| 100 	| true  	| true  	| true           	| 0+1 = 1 	|
| 9  	|   	| 50  	| true  	| true  	| true           	| 1+1 = 2 	|
| 8  	|   	| 25  	| true  	| true  	| true           	| 2+1 = 3 	|
| 7  	|   	| 12  	| true  	| true  	| true           	| 3+1 = 4 	|
| 6  	|   	| 6   	| true  	| false 	| false          	|         	|

Note that we don't have columns for `a` and `c` again even though they are modified inside the loop because columns for those variables are already present in the table by virtue of step 2.

## for-loop

A for-loop is more compact than the while loop and *usually* more common in real-life applications.

```java
for(initializations; boolean expression; update(s)) {
  code inside loop;
}
rest of the code;
```

<center><img src="figs/forLoop.png" style="width: 300px;"/></center>

Example:

```java
int result = 0;
for(int i=1; i <= 16; i*=2) {
  result = result + i;
}
println(result);
```

Trace (logic table):

| i  	| i<=16 	| result     	|
|----	|-------	|------------	|
| 1  	| true  	| 0+1 = 1    	|
| 2  	| true  	| 1+2 = 3    	|
| 4  	| true  	| 3+4 = 7    	|
| 8  	| true  	| 7+8 = 15   	|
| 16 	| true  	| 15+16 = 31 	|
| 32 	| false 	|            	|

## Nesting of control structures

Control structures are literally like lego blocks, you can arrange them as you want, depending on the situation. So you can put loops/conditions inside other loops/conditions (and then more loops/conditions inside that and so on).

```java
for(int i=1; i < 13; i+=3) {
	// SOMETHING
}
```

How many times does the control reach the line containing `// SOMETHING`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

  In the above code, the line containing `// SOMETHING` is reached four times (for `i = 1, 4, 7, 10` but not `13` since loop expression is `i < 13` and not `i <= 13`)
</details>

Now, what if that `//SOMETHING` is a loop itself?

```java
for(int i=1; i < 13; i+=3) {
	for(int k=4; k > 1; k--) { 
		//SOMETHING
	} 
	println("Inner loop finished");
}
println("Outer loop finished");
```

We know control reaches line 2 four times. Each time, it sees that there is a loop. Each of the four times, how many times does the inner loop, controlled by variable `k` execute?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Each time, variable `k` in declared and initialized to 4 	- The inner loop executes three times (for `k = 4, 3, 2`). 
- When `k` becomes 1, inner loop exits, reaching `println("Inner loop finished");
</details>

So if we were to add a *tracking variable* and increment it, we get,

```java
int tracker = 0;
for(int i=1; i < 13; i+=3) {
	for(int k=4; k > 1; k--) { 
		tracker++;
	} 
}
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Outer loop executes 4 times.
- For each time outer loop executes, inner loop executes 3 times. 
- Hence, `tracker++` executes 12 times.
- Final value of `tracker = 12`.

Let's take some examples of a situation where such nesting is required.

### Nesting scenario 1

We would like to generate a pattern based on input integer `N > 0`


`N=4`

```
^
^ ^
^ ^ ^
^ ^ ^ ^ 
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

`N=6`

```
^
^ ^
^ ^ ^
^ ^ ^ ^ 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
```

**STEP 1:** There are `N` lines.

Outer loop - 

```java
for(int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
	display current line
	change line using println(); 
}
```

**STEP 2:** Line corresponding to a given value of `i` has `i` caps 

(when `i = 1`, there is 1 cap, when `i = 2` there are 2 caps, and so on ...).

Inner loop - 

```java
for(int k=1; k<=i; k++) {
	print("^");
}
```

****

<details>
<summary><b>COMPLETE SOLUTION</b></summary>

	```java
	for(int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
		for(int k=1; k<=i; k++) {
			print("^");
		}
		println(); 
	}
	```
</details>

### Nesting scenario 2

Change the code so that the symbols alternate between a cap (^) and a dash (-) between lines.

`N=6`

```
^
- -
^ ^ ^
- - - - 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^
- - - - - -
```

The difference from scenario 1 is that if outer loop counter `i` is an odd number, it's a cap (`^`) while if the outer loop counter `i` is an even number, it's a dash (`-`).

So the earlier display statement

```
print("^");
```

will change to,

```java 
if(i%2 == 1) { // odd counter: cap
	print("^");
}
else { // even counter: dash
	print("-");
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>COMPLETE SOLUTION</b></summary>

	```java
	for(int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
		for(int k=1; k<=i; k++) {
			if(i%2 == 1) { // odd counter: cap
				print("^");
			}
			else { // even counter: dash
				print("-");
			}
		}
		println(); 
	}
	```
</details>


### Nesting scenario 3 (Exercise)

Change the code so that the symbols alternate between ^ and - within a line.

`N=6`

```
^
^ -
^ - ^
^ - ^ -
^ - ^ - ^
^ - ^ - ^ -
```

### Nesting scenario 4 (Exercise)

Change the code so that the symbols alternate between ^ and - within a line and also the first symbol on each line is different from the first symbol on the previous line

`N=6`

```
^
- ^
^ - ^
- ^ - ^
^ - ^ - ^
- ^ - ^ - ^
```

# Coding in the real world

Just like in conditions, lets see some real-world scenarios where we need to use loops. 

But there is a problem. Loops usually iterate over a *collection* (an array, list, hashmap, etc). Since we can't assume knowledge of the same in this document, we're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we? 

So, instead we'll iterate over numbers generated via a random-number generator.

## GROUNDWORK - Generating random numbers in Processing

In processing, we can get a random real number between 0 and `n` (including 0 but **excluding** `n`) using,

```java
float r = random(n);
``` 

If we cast the result to an integer, that integer will be between 0 and `n` (including 0 but **excluding** `n`)

```java
int z = (int)r;
```

### EXAMPLE

To generate a number in multiples of 0.5 between 0 and 100 (inclusive on both sides), we first have to generate a random integer between 0 and 200 (inclusive on both sides).

```java
int a = (int)random(0, 201); // remember, 201 is not included!
```

Next, we can divide the resulting integer by 0.5 to get our random and stepped real number.

```java
float b = a * 0.5;
```

### Assumption for scenarios 1 to 3

For scenarios 1 to 3, you may assume that `n` is generated using the following statement:

```java
int x = 1 + (int)random(100); // x can be any integer from 1 to 100
int n = 10*x; // n can be one of the values from [10, 20, ..., 1000]
```


## SCENARIO 1
Write a piece of code that determines the number of times we get a 6 when a normal 6-faced die is rolled `n` times. 


## SCENARIO 2
Write a piece of code that determines the average outcome when a normal 6-faced dice is rolled `n` times.

## SCENARIO 3
Write a piece of code that determines the most frequent outcome when a normal 6-faced dice is rolled `n` times. If there is a tie, display all values. 

## SCENARIO 4
Consider a party where there are 4 people. Call them Alice, Bob, Charles and Diane. Assuming they are all friendly and logical people, the following handshakes will take place:

- Alice with 
	1. Bob
	2. Charles
	3. Diane
- Bob (already shook hands with Alice) with
	1. Charles
	2. Diane
- Charles (already shook hands with Alice and Bob) with
	1. Diane 
- Diane (already shook hands with everyone)

Thus, there are 3+2+1 = 6 handshakes for 4 people.

If a fifth person (Eddie) joins the party, he shakes hands with all others.

Thus, there are **`4`**+3+2+1 = 10 handshakes for 5 people.

A table summarizing this pattern is given below,

| Number of people 	| Number of handshakes         	|
|------------------	|------------------------------	|
| 1                	| 0                            	|
| 2                	| 1                            	|
| 3                	| 2+1                          	|
| 4                	| 3+2+1                        	|
| 5                	| 4+3+2+1                      	|
| ...              	|                              	|
| n                	| (n-1) + (n-2) + .... + 2 + 1 	|

There is actually a very elegant formula to get this value, but for the purpose of our exercise, we'd like you to compute the number of handshakes in a party of `n` people using a loop.

You may assume that `n` is generated using the following statement:

```java
int n = (int)random(101); // n can be any integer from 0 to 100
```
